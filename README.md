<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Steps
we are creating three different pipelines for our use case.

* Data Pipeline
* Training Pipeline
* Inference Pipeline
  
Our system metrics for the ML model are :
* AUC score >75%
* Precision > 65%
* Recall > 75%
