# Lead Scoring Case study - Using only Open Source tools
> CodePro is an EdTech startup that had a phenomenal seed A funding round. 
It used the money to increase its brand awareness. As the marketing spend increased, it got several leads from different sources. Although it had spent significant money on acquiring customers, it had to be profitable in the long run to sustain the business.

## General Information
### Problem statement
> The main objectives of lead scoring are as follows:

* Remove Junk by categorising leads on the basis of propensity to purchase
* Gain insights to streamline lead conversion and address improper targeting

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Steps
we are creating three different pipelines for our use case.

* Data Pipeline
* Training Pipeline
* Inference Pipeline
  
Our system metrics for the ML model are :
* AUC score >75%
* Precision > 65%
* Recall > 75%
